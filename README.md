thymesolr
=========

Proof-of-concept Thymeleaf integration for Solr.


NOTE: this project is an experiment, and it is not intended to be used as a fully functional ResponseWriter, at the moment. Feel free to contribute with pull requests if you are interested.

The /solr_home folder contains a work-in-progress Solr Home configuration.
