Proof-of-concept Thymeleaf integration for Solr.


NOTE: this project is an experiment, and it is not intended to be used as a fully functional ResponseWriter, at the moment. Feel free to contribute with pull requests if you are interested.
The code here is implemented in java, starting from the example developed using the scala language for the book:

The /solr_home folder contains a work-in-progress Solr Home configuration.
